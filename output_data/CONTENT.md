# üì§ Output Data Directory

Once completing `invoke run-discovery`, the following outputs are generated in `output_data/Discovery/`:

- `Results_Instance_{replication}_Network_{network}.csv` üß™  
  Generated by the `run-discovery` task, which wraps `code/data_analysis/discovery_conformal_score.R`.  
  Each file contains bootstrap classification results for a specific replication and network combination.  
  (100 replications √ó 18 networks = 1800 files in total)

The folder `output_data/Discovery/` is created automatically and can be removed with:

```bash
invoke clean-discovery
```

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Precomputed Results

To download and extract the full set of precomputed results, run:

```bash
invoke fetch-results
```

This will populate the `output_data/Results/` folder with previously generated results from our team, directly from the Zenodo archive.

The subfolder `output_data/Results/` contains a full set of precomputed outputs, provided by our team for convenience. These are organized into:

- `Results/Discovery/`: results from the main discovery phase  
- `Results/Validation/`: results used for validation or generalization  
- `Results/Null/`: results under null or baseline conditions

These mirror the structure and naming of files generated by `run-discovery`, and allow downstream steps (e.g., figure generation) to be reproduced without recomputing the full analysis.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Recomputing the full output takes approximately 30 minutes per replicate/network (‚àº37 days total serial time). Use these archives to save time and electricity.
