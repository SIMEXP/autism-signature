# 📤 Output Data Directory

Once completing `invoke run-all`, the outputs will be generated in the following folders:
* `output_data/Discovery/`
* `output_data/Validation/`
* `output_data/Null/`
* `output_data/Figures/`

The content of these folders can be removed using:
```bash
invoke clean-all
```

---

## 🗃️ Precomputed Results

To download and extract the full set of precomputed results, run:

```bash
invoke fetch-results
```

This will populate the `output_data/Results/` folder with previously generated results from our team, directly from the Zenodo archive. These mirror the structure and naming of files generated by `run-discovery`, and allow downstream steps (e.g., figure generation) to be reproduced without recomputing the full analysis.
